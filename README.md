# liquid-refreshment
Liquid Refreshment is an sinatra application that I created to help me keep
track of a constantly changing roster of beers at a local brewery I frequent.
This brewery releases a handful of beers every month, and has a constant rotation
throughout the year. Every January they have a big birthday party, and a vote
leading up to it to 'bing back a beer' but the problem is that no one can remember
what the hell they drank in the year prior. This application aims to solve that
problem by allowing any user to add or edit a beer description (sometimes they
can be very long an nonsensical) wikipedia style, but then also rate a beer as
it pertains to their personal account so they can keep track of what they rated
over the corse of the year.
